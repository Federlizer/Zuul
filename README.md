# Zuul Game
This is a very basic zuul game implementatation. The main idea of the architecture of the game is that it should be easily expansible. Meaning, ease of adventure creation, new items, new enemies, etc. 

## What is Zuul
The name zuul comes from one of my first semester's excercises in university. The teacher had made a basic demo of a game called Zork, and had called it "Zuul". We basically had to improve the game and made our own copies of it and we could also team up.

The game in this repository is a recreation of the game we (me and a couple of other classmates) created. A link to the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Tropson/Zuul).

###### Run
